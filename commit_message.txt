fix(navigation): repair broken FAQ links in article TOCs

This commit addresses an issue where the "常見問題" (FAQ) link in the Table of Contents (TOC) of multiple articles was pointing to the wrong anchor.

- Corrected the href attribute in <a> tags to point to the correct id="faq-main-title" of the <h2> heading.
- Added missing TOC structures for pages where the TOC was absent.
- Ensured consistency across all processed articles for improved user navigation and accessibility.
- Updated CHANGELOG.md to reflect these fixes.
